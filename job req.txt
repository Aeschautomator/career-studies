Job Requirements Checklist

Employer Competitive candidates are clear on their career desires and their job requirements. This clarity of thought comes through in interviews when Employer Competitive candidates clearly
 articulate why they believe a job is a perfect fit for them. We start this milestone, therefore, by asking you to describe the job you are looking for. 

Use this guide to help you think about what you want so that you are easily able to narrow your job search as needed. 
This should be a living document -- as you progress throughout the boot camp, your interests may change, so make changes here accordingly. 
Feel free to create additional rows and indicate your preferences in the guide below.
